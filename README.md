# 🛍️ E-Commerce Functionality and Styling Project

This project is focused on implementing the core **functionality** and **basic styling** of an existing e-commerce website structure. The HTML markup is already provided, and our job is to bring the page to life with JavaScript and CSS — making it interactive and visually appealing using **Bootstrap**.
